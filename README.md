Object Oriented Programming Assignment 1

This program will take in lyrics of a song and then display the word frequency and word count in a (hopefully) visually pleasing way.
I'll use a bar chart and a way I made up that lets the user choose the word which is then displayed on the screen. The size of the word is determined by its frequency.

I chose song lyrics as my data set because I thought it would be interesting to see how often different words are used and how different songs compare.

To use the program click on one of the songs in the menu. The song chosen plays in the background using the minim library.

Use the up and down arrow keys to switch between the bar chart and the word cloud.
Press 'm' to return to the menu at any time.

You can resize it if you want, but keep the width two times the height, (1000,500) for example. I think (1600,900) works the best for a 1080p screen.
