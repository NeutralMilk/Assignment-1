Object Oriented Programming Assignment 1

This program will take in lyrics of a song (or any text file) and then display some facts about the words like word and letter frequency and word count in a (hopefully) visually pleasing way.
I'll use bar charts, a bubble chart and some other methods I havent decided on yet to display the data.

I chose song lyrics as my data set because I thought it would be interesting to see how often different words are used.
